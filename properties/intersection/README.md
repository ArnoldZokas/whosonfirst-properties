# intersection

The `intersection:latitude` and `intersection:longitude` are used in [intersection records](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/placetypes/intersection/) to indicate the location of an intersection. 

At the time of this writing, `intersection` centroids are only available on records with an `intersection` placetype.

The values are latitude and longitude values from the source data used to generate the Voronoi intersection polygons.

## latitude
The coordinate that specifies a intersections's northâ€“south position. Latitude is a decimal number between _-90.0_ and _90.0_.

## longitude
The coordinate that specifies a intersections's east-west position. Longitude is a decimal number between _-180.0_ and _180.0_.
